\chapter{Elementary Matrix}\label{bil:ElementaryMatrix}
The following is based on \cite[126-127]{LiAl}.\\
An elementary matrix is a matrix, which represents elementary row operations. The elementary matrix is obtained by doing elementary row operations on the identity matrix. An example of Elementary matrix for $2\times 2$ matrix is shown:
\begin{example}{123}
 When multiplying the second row in a $2 \times 2$ matrix with a scalar, the elementary matrix will be represented as:
\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \xrightarrow{r_2k\rightarrow r_2}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & k
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
When using the Interchange operation, the following matrix is used for a $2\times 2$ matrix:
\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \xrightarrow{r_1\leftrightarrow r_2}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
When using the row addition operation, the following matrix is used for a $2\times 2$ matrix, where the first row, is added on to the second row:
\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \xrightarrow{r_2 + r_1k\rightarrow r_2}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0\\
        1+k & 1
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
\end{example}
From this the reduced row echelon form $R$ of a matrix $A$ can be obtained by multiplying with a elementary matrices correspondent to the row operation needed to obtain $R$ from $A$.
\begin{align*}
    E_K\cdots E_2E_1A=R
\end{align*}
From this a matrix $P$ can be defined as $P=E_K\cdots E_2E_1$. It then follows that
\begin{align*}
    PA=R
\end{align*}
All row operations have the ability be be reversed by an another row operation. By this all elementary matrix have another elementary matrix with its inverse and $P$ is invertible.
