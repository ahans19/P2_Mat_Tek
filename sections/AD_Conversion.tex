\section{Sampling}
In section ?? it was established that a continues signal y(t) can be represented as a discreet sequence y[t] of samples with a sample period $T$. 
 It is often desirable to reconstruct signal from the discreet sequence. To do so the sequence must be uniquely determined. What or not a discreet sequence is uniquely determined is dependent on two parameters, the sample period and the bandwidth of the original signal. As described in section ?? a single can decomposed into the its frequency. The bandwidth the maximum frequency of a signal. This is possible to determine since the frequency is often but on not always bounded in practice.   

\begin{theorem}{Nyquist-Shannon theorem}
    If the denotes $\omega_N$ the maximum frequency  of a signal $y(t)$ then in order for the samples $y[k]$ to be uniquely determined the sample frequency $\omega_s$ must satisfy
    \begin{align*}
        \omega_s \geq 2\omega_N.
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
